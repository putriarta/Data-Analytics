## Overview

This project aims to do the customer segmentation (clustering), by classifying customers based on the similarity of their characteristics. I'm using unsupervised machine learning techniques, which is K-prototypes, a combination of k-means and k-modes. I do data exploration, processing the data, modelling, and also test the model with new data.
