### Overview

The aim of this project is to build model that can predict whether user opens the email campaign sent by a company. 
I performed data pre-processing, modelling, training and testing, and also predicting the unlabelled dataset.
The machine learning algorithms that I used are Random Forest and Neural Network. 

From the model evaluation, it is concluded that Random Forest model performed well than Neural Network model with 0.88 f1-score on test dataset.
However, it is recommended to increase the dataset that contains the 'open' labels, so the model can be trained better.
