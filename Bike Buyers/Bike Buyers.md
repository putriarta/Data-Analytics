### Overview
This was my submission for Big Data Analytics 2 final exam.
Using bike buyers dataset obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers, I performed the classification technique 
to predict whether an user will buy a bicycle based on their personal information. It is found that the model using Random Forest able to 
perform better than Naive Bayes and Neural Network in this case with test accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.763, 0.769, and 0.73 respectively.
