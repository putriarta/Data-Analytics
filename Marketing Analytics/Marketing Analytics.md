### Overview

This project aims to build models that can predict whether a user will open the email campaigns sent by company. 
The dataset contains user-specific information, email nature, users’ engagement on the platform, and user’s reaction to the email, including whether users opened the email.
By using Random Forest and Neural Network methods to model and train the data, it is concluded that the Random Forest model performed better with f-score of 0.878. 
As for the classification results on unlabelled data, it is predicted that 5,0223 of 55,970 users will open the email campaign sent by company.
