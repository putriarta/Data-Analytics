### Overview
As the e-commerce site with the most website visitors throughout 2020 in Indonesia, Shopee uses email as their direct marketing channel to improve relationships with customers and offer their products or services. With the dataset given that contains user-specific information, email nature, users’ engagement on the platform, and user’s reaction to the email, including whether users opened the email, they expected to predict whether each user will open an email sent to them within the unlabelled data. By using Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network methods to model and train the data, it is concluded that the model using Random Forest is able to predict the classification better than the other methods with test accuracy, f-score, and MCC score of 0.887, 0.874, and 0.510 respectively. As from the classification results on unlabelled data, it is predicted that 4,673 of 55,970 users will open the campaign email from Shopee.
